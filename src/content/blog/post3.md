### **1. DNS Management**

- **Dynamic DNS (DDNS):** Map your changing home IP to a domain/subdomain automatically.
- **Fast global DNS:** Their network resolves your domain quickly from anywhere.

---

### **2. Reverse Proxy & DDoS Protection**

- Put your homelab services (e.g., Nextcloud, Jellyfin, Proxmox UI) behind Cloudflare.
- **Benefits:**

  - Hides your real home IP.
  - Filters malicious traffic before it reaches you.
  - Can block countries, bots, or suspicious requests.

---

### **3. Secure Remote Access**

- **Cloudflare Tunnel (a.k.a. Argo Tunnel):**

  - Lets you expose internal apps to the internet _without_ opening ports on your router.
  - Works through an outbound connection from your server to Cloudflare.
  - Great for avoiding ISP NAT issues.

---

### **4. SSL/TLS for Free**

- Use Cloudflareâ€™s free SSL certificates to get HTTPS for all your homelab web apps.

---

### **5. Access Control**

- **Cloudflare Access**: SSO & 2FA for your services (login with Google, GitHub, etc.).

ðŸ’¡ Many homelabbers run something like:
`[Service in Docker/VM] â†’ [Cloudflare Tunnel] â†’ [Cloudflare DNS + Security] â†’ [User's Browser]`

If you want, I can make you a **diagram showing Cloudflare in a homelab network** so itâ€™s easier to visualize. That would make it crystal clear how traffic flows.
